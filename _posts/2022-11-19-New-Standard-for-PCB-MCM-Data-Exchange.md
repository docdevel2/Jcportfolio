Abstract
Todayâ€™s PCB and MCM designers often work in a heterogeneous environment in which software from multiple Electronic Design Automation (EDA) software vendors is used to create design and manufacturing data. In this environment, data must be shared between groups, transferred to manufacturers, or archived for later retrieval. A smooth seamless interface between the designer and manufacturer helps designers meet their goals for minimum time to market of their products and lower product cost. Standards allow designers to develop products in multi-vendor environments without requiring tight integration of tools. This paper discusses the value of EDIF 4 0 0 for transferring design and manufacturing data for PCBs and MCMs.
