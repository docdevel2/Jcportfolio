## Abstract  
Since the turn of this millennium, there are a few significant advances in database architecture that have changed the database landscape. From these architectural advances, column-store database management systems (DBMS) have emerged. Column-store DBMSs have enabled the rapid growth in data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning. This article highlights three particular architectural advances and the challenges that they address.
