## Abstract
Advances in packaging technologies have enabled dramatic size reductions in  portable and wireless products. While the packaging size for integrated circuits is decreasing, pin count is increasing. The resulting increase in pin and interconnect density, however, exceeds the limits of traditional printed circuit board (PCB) manufacturing technologies. The emergence of microvia PCB technology provides a bridge between high-density packaging and traditional PCB technologies. The more demanding requirements of microvia technology, however, introduce new challenges for many of todayâ€™s PCB design tools. For portable and wireless product designers, these design challenges are compounded by the requirement to combine digital, analog, and RF (radio frequency) circuitry on a heterogeneous substrate. Without the right set of design tools, design iterations resulting from functional and manufacturing errors are likely to occur. This paper discusses the design and manufacturing issues that drive design tool requirements, and some of the solutions available today.
