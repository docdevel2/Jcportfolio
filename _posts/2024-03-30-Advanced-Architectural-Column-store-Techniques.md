## Abstract  
Data analytics applications require databases that can reach sizes in the terabyte to petabyte ranges, thus the need for speed and capacity. Today's column-store database architectures are designed to address these needs. They depart from traditional row-store database architectures. Column-store database systems employ advanced architectural techniques that leverage faster **CPUs**, large fast **cache** memory, and higher capacity disks to accelerate query execution. This article reveals some of these architectural techniques and how they evolved.  

Keywords: Column-store, row-store, RDBMS, relational database, vector database
