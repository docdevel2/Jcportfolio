## Abstract
The rapid growth in demand for wireless products is driving the need for design tools that allow designers to meet evermore challenging design constraints. Decreasing product life cycles and shrinking product size impose new challenges to RF product designers. Advances in packaging and substrate technologies that employ embedded passive components allow RF designers to achieve size targets and performance goals not previously achievable.

Keywords: EDA, Embedded Passives, Integral Passives, PCB, RF Design, Wireless Design
